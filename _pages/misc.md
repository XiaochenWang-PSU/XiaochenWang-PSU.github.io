I primarily spend my spare time exploring the humanities. My philosophical and aesthetic sensibilities have been deeply influenced by figures such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Ryūnosuke Akutagawa (芥川 龍之介). In addition, I enjoy the music of King Crimson, the films of Akira Kurosawa (黒澤 明), and the paintings of Utagawa Hiroshige (歌川 広重).

Although not yet fully realized, I am exploring ways to integrate these personal interests into my research.
